This SS tool provides some useful scans such the scan of the .minecraft, logs of the temp, downloads and prefetch. <br>
If this ss tool found something strange the colors will change, you can see this better in the next part.

**Color meanings** <br>
*  **Color blue**<br>
  This is a .zip file you should check it but it should be normal, some people try to bypass hacks in this type of files so please cheack that.
*  **Color red**<br>
  This is .dll which is extremely strange, the user might be using some null dll check that dll most of times is some type or hack, but it could be just a normal dll. <br>
*  **Color yellow** <br>
  This is a .exe, it could be just normal but you should check it because most of the ghost clients which are externals are located in this type of file, I recomend you to <br>
  check it.<br>

# Important note
